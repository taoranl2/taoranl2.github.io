About Me
======

I am currently a second-year Master's student in [Computer Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), working with Prof. [Varun Chandrasekaran](https://chandrasekaran-group.github.io/). I feel fortunate to have met many kind and talented professors who have supported and inspired my journey. I am grateful to Prof. [David Heath](https://daheath.web.illinois.edu/) and Prof. [Yupeng Zhang](https://zhangyp.web.illinois.edu/), whose guidance introduced me to the fascinating world of cryptography, and to Prof. [Varun Chandrasekaran](https://chandrasekaran-group.github.io/), whose mentorship has been invaluable in beginning my academic journey.

Before joining UIUC in 2023, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering through a joint program between the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) and [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). During my undergraduate studies, I had the privilege of working with Prof. [Wee-Liat Ong](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/owl), Prof. [Gaoang Wang](https://cvnext.github.io/), and Prof. [Thomas Honold](https://zjui.intl.zju.edu.cn/en/node/775).

  - **Secure and Practical AI Systems**: Creating robust, resilient AI models that withstand adversarial attacks and maintain user data privacy.
  - **Machine Unlearning**: Investigating efficient algorithms and frameworks for safely removing data from trained machine learning models, ensuring regulatory compliance and privacy protection.
  - **AI for Code Generation, Debugging, Translation, and Vulnerability Detection**: Leveraging large language models to automate secure coding practices, improve debugging effectiveness, facilitate code translation, and identify potential security vulnerabilities.

- **Security and Privacy of IoT and Cyber-Physical Systems**
  - **Secure AI Integration in Robotics and Autonomous Vehicles**: Developing secure, resilient AI solutions to ensure reliable operation and safety in robotic systems and autonomous transportation.
  - **Enhancing Safety and Resilience of Interconnected Systems**: Strengthening security frameworks for IoT-enabled smart infrastructures, enhancing their capability to resist cyber-attacks and privacy breaches.


    
Miscellaneous
======
I enjoy cooking Chinese food with my friends. Additionally, I have a passion for hiking and photography, especially in natural environments. I have had the opportunity to visit several national parks, where I capture the beauty of the landscapes through my lens. The national parks I have visited include:

- Grand Canyon National Park
- Joshua Tree National Park
- Indiana Dunes National Park
- Grand Teton National Park
- Yellowstone National Park
- Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve
- Rocky Mountain National Park
