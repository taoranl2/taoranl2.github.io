About Me
======

I am currently a second-year Master's student in [Computer Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), working with Prof. [Varun Chandrasekaran](https://chandrasekaran-group.github.io/). I feel fortunate to have met many kind and talented professors who have supported and inspired my journey. I am grateful to Prof. [David Heath](https://daheath.web.illinois.edu/) and Prof. [Yupeng Zhang](https://zhangyp.web.illinois.edu/), whose guidance introduced me to the fascinating world of cryptography, and to Prof. [Varun Chandrasekaran](https://chandrasekaran-group.github.io/), whose mentorship has been invaluable in beginning my academic journey.

Before joining UIUC in 2023, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering through a joint program between the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) and [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). During my undergraduate studies, I had the privilege of working with Prof. [Wee-Liat Ong](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/owl), Prof. [Gaoang Wang](https://cvnext.github.io/), and Prof. Thomas Honold.

  - Secure multi-party computation (MPC)
  - Zero-knowledge Proof (zk-SNARK)
  - Data privacy and scalable cryptographic solutions

- **Interaction of Cryptography and Machine Learning**
  - Detecting and mitigating data poisoning attacks
  - Machine unlearning techniques for secure AI systems
  - Privacy-preserving techniques, including federated learning and differential privacy
    
- **Trustworthy Machine Learning**
  - Integrating cryptographic protocols with machine learning models
  - Developing secure and practical AI systems
 
- **Security and Privacy of IoT and Cyber-Physical Systems**
  - Integrating secure AI into robotics and autonomous vehicles
  - Enhancing the safety and resilience of interconnected systems

    
Miscellaneous
======
I enjoy cooking Chinese food with my friends. Additionally, I have a passion for hiking and photography, especially in natural environments. I have had the opportunity to visit several national parks, where I capture the beauty of the landscapes through my lens. The national parks I have visited include:

- Grand Canyon National Park
- Joshua Tree National Park
- Indiana Dunes National Park
- Grand Teton National Park
- Yellowstone National Park
- Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve
- Rocky Mountain National Park
