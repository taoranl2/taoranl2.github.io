About Me
======
I am currently a first-year PhD student in [Computer Science](https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/index.html) at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/index.html), advised by Prof. [Zhiyuan Yu](https://zhiyuanyu.org/). My research interests include Trustworthy ML, AI Safety and Applied Cryptography.

Previously, I earned my Master's degree in [Computer Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu/) at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), advised with Prof. [Varun Chandrasekaran](https://chandrasekaran-group.github.io/). I feel fortunate to have met many kind and talented professors who have supported and inspired my journey. I am grateful to Prof. [David Heath](https://daheath.web.illinois.edu/) and Prof. [Yupeng Zhang](https://zhangyp.web.illinois.edu/), whose guidance introduced me to the fascinating world of cryptography, and to Prof. [Varun Chandrasekaran](https://chandrasekaran-group.github.io/), whose mentorship has been invaluable in beginning my academic journey.

Before joining UIUC in 2023, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering through a joint program between the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) and [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). During my undergraduate studies, I had the privilege of working with Prof. [Wee-Liat Ong](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/owl), Prof. [Gaoang Wang](https://cvnext.github.io/), and Prof. [Thomas Honold](https://zjui.intl.zju.edu.cn/en/node/775).

I'm open to collaborating on interesting research ideas. If you are interested in Trustworthy ML/AI Safety and seek collaboration, please feel free to contact me at taoranl2 [at] illinois [dot] edu.
