I enjoy cooking Chinese food with my friends. Additionally, I have a passion for hiking and photography, especially in natural environments. I have had the opportunity to visit several national parks, where I capture the beauty of the landscapes through my lens. The national parks I have visited include:

- Grand Canyon National Park
- Joshua Tree National Park
- Indiana Dunes National Park
- Grand Teton National Park
- Yellowstone National Park
- Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve
- Rocky Mountain National Park
