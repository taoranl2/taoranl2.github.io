I enjoy cooking Chinese food with my friends. Additionally, I have a passion for hiking and photography, especially in natural environments. I have had the opportunity to visit several national parks, where I capture the beauty of the landscapes through my lens. The national parks I have visited include:

- Grand Canyon National Park (12/20/2023)
- Joshua Tree National Park (12/28/2023)
- Indiana Dunes National Park (3/9/2024)
